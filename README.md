Features:
Uses state-wise Female LFPR data.
Customizable thresholds
Clear visualization
Easy to extend

Data:
The data used is state-wise Female LFPR (in %) from the latest available sources (e.g., Economic Survey 2024-25).

Workflow:
Load data from a CSV file.
Assign clusters to each state: Low: LFPR ≤ 20%, Medium: 20% < LFPR ≤ 40%, High: LFPR > 40%

Visualize the clusters using a color-coded bar chart.

Print the list of states in each cluster.
